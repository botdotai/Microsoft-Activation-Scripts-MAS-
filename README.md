Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS)
Open-source Windows and Office activator featuring HWID, Ohook, KMS38, and Online KMS activation methods, along with advanced troubleshooting.

Download / How to use it?

Method 1 - PowerShell (Windows 8 and later) ❤️

Open PowerShell (Not CMD). To do that, right-click on the Windows start menu and select PowerShell or Terminal in windows 8 and later versions.


Copy and paste the code below into the terminal and press enter. Wait for the page to load and follow the onscreen instructions


irm https://get.activated.win | iex

You will see the activation options. Choose (1) HWID for Windows activation. Choose (2) Ohook for Office activation.

That's all.


Method 2 - Traditional (Windows 7 and later)


The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.

Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.

Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.
